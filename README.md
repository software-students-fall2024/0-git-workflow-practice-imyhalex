> >Software engineering is a field that always changes to keep up with innovation and client needs. As developers, we have a difficult job staying up to date with these swift changes. It is imperative that we approach our information sources selectively because it is so easy for anyone to create a blog and publish anything. That is not to argue that material from new bloggers, inexperienced developers, or alternative viewpoints isn't worthwhile. Quite the contrary â€” such sources can provide original perspectives. Still, given our short time, it makes sense to prioritise good-quality, credible material. As with choosing well-regarded books, we should concentrate on reading developer blogs that are regarded by the industry for their professionalism and knowledge.
